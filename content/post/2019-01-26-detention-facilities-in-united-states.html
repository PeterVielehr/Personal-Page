<h2>Mass Incarceration in US</h2>
<p>The United States has the highest rate of imprisonment in the world. With about 1.3 million people in the United States behind bars, the infrastructure needed to house this population is immense and costly. The Prison Policy Initiative <a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/money.html">calculated</a> that the commonly cited figure of 80 billion dollars per year vastly underestimates the true cost of imprisonment. They argue that accounting for police, criminal courts, corrections, and monetary costs to families totals $182 billion.</p>

<p><em>Update: I switched my server setup from AWS to an old desktop that I had lying around. The embedded app was being blocked as unsecure. If the app does not start automatically, click the link to the full screen version.</em></p>

<h3>Visualizing Mass Incarceration’s infrastructure</h3>
<p>While understanding the number of people incarcerated and the costs is important, seeing the scale of incarceration is important. Detention facilities operate at the county, state, and federal levels. This app uses data from the The Prison Policy Initiative’s <a href="www.prisonersofthecensus.org">Prisoners of the Census</a> and maps it using Leaflet with Shiny.</p>

<h4>Shiny Apps/Shiny server</h4>
<p>Making a shiny app is a great way to communicate findings. You can embed your apps on websites if you host it on a server. One option for hosting is through <a href="https://www.shinyapps.io/">Shinyapps.io</a>. This is good for many applications but if you think you will have much web traffic you will need a different hosting server. I use the free tier of Amazon AWS EC2. If I ever need extra computing, I can scale up if needed. I found <a href="https://tm3.ghost.io/2017/12/31/deploying-an-r-shiny-app-to-aws/">several</a> <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-host-a-r-shiny-app-on-aws-cloud-in-7-simple-steps-5595e7885722">good</a> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/running-r-on-aws/">tutorials</a> on setting up a Shiny Server. While it can take a bit of work, once you figure it out it is pretty easy.</p>

<div id="data" class="section level2">
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>The Prison Policy Initiative used data from the 2010 US Census group quarters data to produce state-level .kml files that contain every detention facility counted in the 2010 Census. These files can be used in Google GIS and other GIS software. In R .kml files can be used to create spatial data frames.</p>
<p>The first step is to download the .kml files, load them into R, and create a Spatial Points Data Frame.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>urls&lt;-paste(&quot;http://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/locator2010/kml/state_pts_&quot;, state.abb, &quot;.kml&quot;, sep = &quot;&quot; )
destfiles&lt;-paste0(&quot;/filepath&quot;, state.abb, &quot;_pts.kml&quot;)

for(i in seq_along(urls)){
  download.file(urls[i], destfiles[i], mode=&quot;w&quot;)
} 

##Florida has an error!!! You have to manually change the name of the facility on line 45, remove the &quot;&amp;&quot;. 

temp &lt;- list.files(pattern=&quot;*.kml&quot;)
temp.list&lt;-list()
for(i in seq_along(temp)){
  temp.list[i]&lt;- readOGR(temp[i])
}

spdf&lt;-do.call(&quot;rbind&quot;, temp.list) #Creates a Spatial Points Data Frame</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="mapping-in-leaflet" class="section level2">
<h2>Mapping in Leaflet</h2>
<p>The first step is to clean the labels from the .kml files. I need to get the facility type on it’s own to sort the facilities. The Description is a string with HTML that is helpful for parsing.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df&lt;-as.data.frame(spdf)

s&lt;-df %&gt;% separate(Description, c(&quot;type&quot;, &quot;geoid&quot;, &quot;county&quot;, &quot;population&quot;), 
                   sep = &quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;, remove = F, convert = FALSE, 
                   extra = &quot;warn&quot;, fill = &quot;warn&quot;)

spdf$type&lt;-gsub(&quot;&lt;div&gt;Facility type: &quot;, &quot;&quot;, s$type)

spdf$type&lt;-ifelse(spdf$type==&quot;&quot;, &quot;unknown&quot;, spdf$type)</code></pre>
<p>Next, I grouped together some facility types and gave them colors.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>spdf$type.grouped&lt;- sapply(spdf$type, function(x) {
  if(x==&quot;Local&quot; | x==&quot;Local,Federal&quot; | x==&quot;Local,Private&quot;){
    &quot;Local&quot; 
  } else if(x==&quot;State&quot; | x==&quot;State,Federal&quot; | x==&quot;State,Local&quot; | x==&quot;State,Private&quot;) {
    &quot;State&quot;
  } else if(x==&quot;Private&quot;){
    &quot;Private&quot;
  } else if(x==&quot;Military&quot;){
    &quot;Military&quot;
  } else if(x==&quot;Federal&quot;) {
    &quot;Federal&quot;
  } else if(x==&quot;Halfway House&quot;){
    &quot;Halfway House&quot;
  } else {
    &quot;Other/Unknown&quot;
  }
})

spdf$color&lt;- sapply(spdf$type, function(x) {
  if(x == &quot;Local&quot;) {
    &quot;purple&quot;
  } else if(x == &quot;State&quot;) {
    &quot;saddlebrown&quot;
  } else if(x == &quot;Private&quot;) {
    &quot;blue&quot;
  } else if(x == &quot;Military&quot;) {
    &quot;olivedrab&quot;
  } else if (x== &quot;Federal&quot;) {
    &quot;red&quot;
  } else if (x==&quot;Halfway House&quot;) {
    &quot;cyan&quot;
  } else {
    &quot;green&quot;
  } })

<p>###Create Shiny App</p>
<p>The following code should be in your shiny app and moved to your project folder–ex. <code>/srv/shiny-server/ShinyApps/PrisonsMap</code>–folder along with your data.</p>
<p>I adapted this code from: <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/shiny.html">https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/shiny.html</a></p>
