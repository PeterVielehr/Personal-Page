My partner brought home a box of three week old kittens that had been brought to her work. The man who found them said that during a heavy rainstorm heard tiny meows in his yard and then saw a little kitten face scrambling to get out of a depression. He went to rescue the baby kitten and found **FIVE** kittens, most of them were totally submerged in rising water. 

When we got the kittens home, I did the best thing I knew how to do: start collecting data on their growth. 

We color coded their tail tips with the nail polish we had on hand which led to their color names. 

I made a quick Excel workbook to collect the date, weight in grams, and comments for each cat. A few days later, I forgot to weigh before dinner so I weighed after eating. I realized that it would be a good way to track their food consumption. I'm glad I took the two measures. The kittens got a little older and very wiggly before meals. The measurement error would have another measurement to track average growth.

# Now Plot Their Progress

Load some packages and data. I used the forcats package to recode factors and was looking for a way to use purrr but didn't have a good use case.

```{r }

library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
library(gganimate)
library(sjPlot)

load("Kittens.Rda")

kable(head(kittens))
```

## Plotting Kitten Growth

The raw data need a bit of recoding. I do several things in the next block:

1. Make a color variable to use in the plots.
2. Re-code the "weight.taken" variable so that it will be correct in the plots.
    + Order the weight.taken variable levels so that the before eating comes first.
3. Make a sex variable based on the cat's sex.
4. Make a numeric date variable that will be used in the regression. Zero is the first day. 

```{r recode variables}
kittens.coded<-kittens %>%
  mutate(color=fct_recode(Cat, 
                          "black" = "No Tip",
                          "violet" = "Lavender" ),
         color=tolower(color),
         weight.taken=fct_recode(Pre_post.eating,
                                 "Before Eating" = "Pre-eating" ,
                                 "After Eating" = "Post-eating"),
         weight.taken=fct_relevel(weight.taken,"Before Eating"),
         sex=fct_collapse(Cat,
                          female= c("Blue", "Maroon"),
                          male= c("Green", "Lavender", "No Tip")),
         day.num=as.numeric(Date)-18055)
```

Now to plot with ggplot2

```{r trajectories, echo=T}
kittentraj<-kittens.coded %>%
  ggplot(aes(Date, Weight, color=Cat)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_color_manual(values = kittens.coded$color)+
  facet_grid(~ weight.taken) + 
  ggtitle("Foster Kitten Weight (Grams)") 

kittentraj

```

It is also helpful to split the plots by each kitten so that we can see their weight pre- and post-eating easier.

```{r individual}
kittens.sep<-kittens.coded %>%
  ggplot(aes(Date, Weight, color=weight.taken)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ Cat) + 
  ggtitle("Foster Kitten Weight (Grams)") + 
  labs(color = "Weight Taken") 

kittens.sep
```

## Animating Plots

I wanted to play around a bit more with the gganimate package so I made gifs of the growth charts. 

```{r, eval=TRUE}
kittentraj + 
  geom_point(aes(group = seq_along(Date))) +
  transition_reveal(Date)
```



``` {r, eval=TRUE}
kittens.sep + 
  geom_point(aes(group = seq_along(Date))) +
  transition_reveal(Date)
```



## Averaging growth trends

The daily data are a bit messy but look remarkably linear. I'm interested in how fast they are growing every day and whether the cats are differing in their growth trajectories. To test this, I can estimate a logistic regression model that includes the day number and controlling for measurement time and which cat is weighed. 

The intercept is when all independent variables equal 0 or substantively: the average weight in grams for Blue after eating on the first day she came home. 

I added sex to the model but ran into an identification issue. Since all the measurements for each cat are either male or female controls for the cat *and* sex can't be included in the same model. A multilevel model with random intercept for cats can do this and shows that the female cats are slightly smaller than the males but there is not a lot of variation between cats. 

```{r}
weightlm<-lm(Weight ~ day.num + Pre_post.eating + Cat, kittens.coded)
summary(weightlm)

```

**The Kittens grow `r paste0(round(coef(weightlm)["day.num"], digits = 1), "g")` per day on average!!**

A few plots can be made to show the predicted weight of a cat over time and differences in the average weight of the cats. 

```{r}
plot_model(weightlm, type = "pred", terms = c("day.num"))

plot_model(weightlm, type = "pred", terms = c( "Cat"),
           colors = kittens.coded$color)

```

Blue looks to be really small in the last graph, but it does not take time into account. 

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="60%", out.height="50%", fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics(c("../../img/Blue_face.JPG"))
```

To examine trajectory differences, create an interaction term between day and Cat. 

The resulting plot shows the average trajectories of each cat.

```{r}
weightlm.int<-lm(Weight ~ day.num + Pre_post.eating +  Cat*day.num, kittens.coded)

summary(weightlm.int)

plot_model(weightlm.int, type = "pred", terms = c("day.num", "Cat"),
           colors = kittens.coded$color)

```

They grow up so fast!
