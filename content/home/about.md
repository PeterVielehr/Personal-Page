# Biography

I am a Ph.D. candidate in sociology at Vanderbilt University. My dissertaion research focuses on the mental and physical health impacts of proactive policing in Nashville. More broadly, I am interested in how structures of social control (i.e. police, prisons, probation, parole) contribute to inequality accross the life course. I use quantitative and computational methodologies to investigate complex social issues.
