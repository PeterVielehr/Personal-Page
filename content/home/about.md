# Biography

I recently defended my [dissertation](/files/Vielehr-final dissertation.pdf) in sociology at Vanderbilt University. My dissertation research focused on racial disparites and bias in discretionary vehicle searches as well as the mental health impacts of proactive policing in Nashville. 

I am interested in how structures and policies related to social control (i.e. police, prisons, probation, parole) contribute to race, gender, and socioeconomic inequality across the life course. I use quantitative and computational methodologies to investigate complex social issues.
