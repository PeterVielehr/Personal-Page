# Biography

I am a Ph.D. candidate in sociology at Vanderbilt University. My dissertation research focuses on the mental and physical health impacts of proactive policing in Nashville. Police are a salient social institution in the lives of many, especially racial and ethnic minorities. Police agencies often argue that aggressive tactics are effective at reducing crime through focused deterrence. Many community members argue that heavy policing creates a culture of surveillance that undermines social trust and belonging. My dissertation examines these claims using police administrative data and a health survey of Nashville, TN. 

More broadly, I am interested in how structures of social control (i.e. police, prisons, probation, parole) contribute to race, gender, and socioeconomic inequality across the life course. I use quantitative and computational methodologies to investigate complex social issues.
