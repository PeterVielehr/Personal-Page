      <description>Mass Incarceration in US The United States has the highest rate of imprisonment in the world. With about 1.3 million people in the United States behind bars, the infrastructure needed to house this population is immense and costly. The Prison Policy Initiative calculated that the commonly cited figure of 80 billion dollars per year vastly underestimates the true cost of imprisonment. They argue that accounting for police, criminal courts, corrections, and monetary costs to families totals 182 billion dollars.</description>

      <description>Hit-rate for Searches Hit rates are an important way to investigate racial bias in search decisions. If a police officer decides to conduct a discretionary search, they make the decision based on their perceived likelihood of finding evidence of a crime. Probable cause searches, in particular, have an evidentiary burden where the officer must meet the reasonable person standard set by the Supreme Court. The officer must have articulable facts and circumstances that a reasonable officer would believe indicates a crime.</description>
